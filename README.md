# 🌌 Parallax Scrolling Website

This project is a visually stunning front-end landing page. The primary goal was to build a complete "Parallax" effect (where different layers move at different speeds on scroll) entirely from scratch using **Vanilla JavaScript** (no external libraries).

The project demonstrates advanced skills in DOM manipulation, CSS `transform` properties, and highly efficient `scroll event` handling.
